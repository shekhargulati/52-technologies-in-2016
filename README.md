[Docker](http://docker.com/) is a container technology that allows us to package an application and its dependencies together in a filesystem so that they can be deployed together on any server. This helps us achieve package once deploy anywhere. So, in the next few posts of this series, we will learn how Java developers can get started with Docker.

40. **[Week 40: October 19, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/40-docker-cron)** [Using Docker Containers As Cron Jobs](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/40-docker-cron/README.md): This week I was working on a problem that required cron jobs. The use case was that after user registers with the application, we will create a cron job that will track his/her social activities. We will have one container per user. I wanted to keep cron jobs to work in a different process from the main application so that different concerns of the application don't intermingle. In my view, containers provide the right abstraction to solve this use case.

This post assumes you already know Akka. Actor needs a dispatcher to perform its task. A dispatcher relies on executor to provide thread. There are two types of executors a dispatcher can have: 1) `fork-join-executor` 2) `thread-pool-executor`. In this post, we will understand how you can configure `fork-join-executor` and `thread-pool-executor` to meet your needs.

This post will also cover how to use Docker Compose with [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it). `wait-for-it` is a simple bash utility to test and wait for the availability of TCP host and port.

43. **[Week 43: December 26, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/43-graphql)** [GraphQL - building a pokedex in React with GraphQL](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/43-graphql/README.md): [GraphQL](http://graphql.org), a query language that is starting to get more and more attention. Facebook, who internally used GraphQL since 2012 and released a first specification and reference implementation of GraphQL in 2015 announced GraphQL to be [production ready] in September 2016. What followed is a trend of more and more companies starting to use GraphQL, such as GitHub, Coursera and Shopify.
